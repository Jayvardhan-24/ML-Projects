  - Accuracy and performance metrics
 
### 3. 📺 Netflix Recommendation System
  This project builds a movie recommendation system using real-world Netflix data. It demonstrates fundamental steps of working with a large dataset, including preprocessing, cleaning, analyzing, and building a 
  basic collaborative filtering model to suggest movies to users based on their past interactions.

**🔍 Project Highlights:**
- **Data Loading & Cleaning:** Loaded a raw Netflix dataset from .zip format and handled missing/null values to separate user IDs and movie IDs.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Analyzed user rating distributions, frequency of movie ratings, and customer behavior patterns.
- **Recommendation Engine:** Implemented a collaborative filtering approach using cosine similarity to suggest movies that are similar based on user preferences.
- **Visualization:** Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize key insights, such as rating distributions and popular movies.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

### 4. 🌦️ Weather Forecasting Using Time Series Models
  This project focuses on predicting future weather patterns using historical data through time series forecasting techniques. It involves analyzing trends and seasonality in weather data and building models to
  forecast variables like temperature, humidity, or rainfall.

🔍 Key Features:
  - Time series analysis of historical weather data
  - Forecasting using models like ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM
  - Visualizations for trends, seasonality, and model forecasts
  - Evaluation using metrics like RMSE and MAE

### 5. 🎵 Music Recommender System
  A simple web app built with Streamlit and Spotipy that recommends songs based on your selection and displays album covers using the Spotify API.

Features:
 - Suggests 5 similar songs for any selected track
 - Fetches album covers dynamically via Spotify API
 - Smooth loading spinner while fetching recommendations
 - Automatically generates required data files (df.pkl and similarity.pkl) from CSV

Dependencies:
 - Python 3.x
 - Streamlit
 - Spotipy
 - Pandas
 - scikit-learn

📈 A great starting point for anyone exploring data science, machine learning, and time series forecasting in real-world scenarios.
