# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of machine learning projects! This repository contains end-to-end ML solutions using real-world datasets, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects Included

### 1. ðŸ“Š COVID-19 Analysis Project
- **Description:** Predictive modeling and data visualization to analyze the spread and impact of COVID-19.
- **Tech Stack:** Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Key Features:**
  - Data cleaning and exploration
  - Time series trend analysis
  - Machine learning models for prediction

### 2. ðŸ“ˆ Census Income Prediction Project
- **Description:** Classification model to predict whether a person's income exceeds $50K based on census data.
- **Tech Stack:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy
- **Key Features:**
  - Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding)
  - Model building and evaluation (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
  - Accuracy and performance metrics

## ðŸš§ Upcoming Projects
New ML projects will be added regularly, including:
- Regression and classification challenges
- Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- Deep learning models
- Model deployment examples
